	<h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Hello, this is for my computer coding class culminating portfolio.<br><br>
	  My name is Zane. I'm a 18 dumbass broke student and I really enjoy coding minus the hours of my break hurting from sitting too long in one sitting. I'm genuinely thinking of making coding a job to work in but then again, I might not.<br><br>
	  I dunno, I'm still thinking of what my job goal is to work in the future-<br><br>
	  To be fair, I haven't really done much during this class but I have learned a few more thing more than compare to when I haven't taken this class.<br>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Web devlopment</li> 
		  <li>Basic python on replit</li>
		  <li>Unity.. although I didn't really paid attention to the coding part nor actually started making a unity game since I was too busy thinking and making my sprites for my little game (that is still not finished but I do have a lot ideas and story lore for it.. so that counts.. right?? Right???)</li>
			  <p><br>Give me a break :(<br>I wanted my first game to be top qulaltiy and good. Plus it was a one-man job, there's a lot to work with and it's harder since I'm the type that likes to really take their time and think a lot.</p>
		  </ul>
	
I've taken an interest of coding mainly because of my love for gaming and honestly for my entire highschool life, I've been trying to find out what class teaches coding and have taken the wrong type of classes every grade. It was still coding related but it wasn't the one I was looking for y'know? But hey, grade 12 and I finally found it! Yippeee!!<br><br>
	  And if you're wondering, no, I didn't have the guts to asked my guidance or my teachers if a coding class for programming for game development or something remotely close to it existed.<br><br>
	  Anyways ...<br>
	  Here's some of my proud small little projects that I've done in class :)
